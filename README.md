PROJECT-1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PROJECT

This project focuses on predicting the survival likelihood of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and embarkation point. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes historical data to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. The goal is to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates and to build a predictive model that can generalize to unseen data. The Titanic Survival Prediction project provides an opportunity to explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques to predictive model for survival on a historical context.

PROJECT-2 : SMS CLASSIFIER

The SMS Classifier project is designed to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages in SMS texts. By using machine learning algorithms, the model learns patterns and characteristics of spam messages to make accurate predictions. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of classification algorithms. The SMS Classifier is particularly relevant for addressing the challenge of identifying and filtering out unwanted messages in real-world communication channels. It offers practical insights into text classification and the application of machine learning in spam detection.
